## 1. Exploring Academic Success and Demographics by Borough ##

combined<-read_csv("combined.csv")

## 2. Defining "Missing Data" ##

summary<-combined %>% 
group_by(boro) %>% 
summarize(mean(avg_sat_score))

## 3. Contagious Missing Values ##

summary <- combined %>%
  group_by(boro) %>%
  summarize(mean(avg_sat_score,na.rm=TRUE))

## 4. Dropping Rows With Missing Values for one Variable ##

summary <- combined %>%
  group_by(boro) %>%
  summarize(mean(avg_sat_score, na.rm = TRUE))
summary_2<- combined %>% 
drop_na(boro) %>% 
group_by(boro) %>% 
summarize(sat_avg=mean(avg_sat_score,na.rm=TRUE))

## 5. Complete Cases: Dropping All Rows With Missing Data ##

summary_3 <- combined %>% 
drop_na() %>% 
group_by(boro) %>% 
summarize(mean(avg_sat_score))

## 6. Using Complete Cases: When to Avoid ##

na_count<-colSums(is.na(combined))

## 7. Understanding Effects of Different Techniques for Handling Missing Data ##

summary_4<-combined %>% 
drop_na(boro) %>% 
group_by(boro) %>% 
summarize(mean(avg_sat_score,na.rm=TRUE),
          mean(frl_percent,na.rm=TRUE),
          mean(`AP Test Takers`,na.rm=TRUE))

## 8. Imputing to Replace Missing Data ##

combined<-combined %>% mutate(`AP Test Takers`=replace_na(`AP Test Takers`,2.5))
combined_2<-combined %>%
drop_na(boro)

ggplot(data=combined_2) + 
aes(x=boro,y=`AP Test Takers`) +
